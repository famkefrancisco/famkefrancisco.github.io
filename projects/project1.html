    <p style="text-align:center;">Jose Rizal was born in Calamba, Laguna in the Philippines in June of 1861 and was named Jose Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda.
        Joseâ€™s family lived on rented property that was owned by a religious order from Dominica, which made them a family of wealthy farmers.
        Although the family were descendents of a Chinese immigrant, the family began using Mercado as their last name in order to hide their family background because of sentiments against the Chinese at the time.</p>
